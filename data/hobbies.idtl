My hobbies are primarily divided into these major areas:
<details open>
  <summary>Anime, Manga and Games</summary>
  When I free, I spent the majority of my time in enjoying those stuffs. It is become my primary hobby
  since my exposure toward the Japanese language since I am 17. <br>
  Currently the genre that I am really into are the following: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>School Love</li>
    <li>Shoujo (少女) </li>
    <li>Josei (女性) </li>
    <li>Slice of Life (日常系)</li>
    <li>Iyashikei (癒やし系)</li>
  </ul>
  For games, I have played numerous gacha games such as Love Live! School idol festival in the past
  however due to the time constraint that happened as result of the tight schedule I have decided to
  abandoned it. The recently I have decided to continue the Genshin Impact that I have abandoned in the past.

  <summary>Programming</summary>
  In the span of night years, I have experienced and gained the knowledges in the following languages.
  <ul>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>SQL (Postgresql and SQL Server)</li>
    <li>Golang</li>
    <li>Perl 5</li>
  </ul>
  In overall the programming is not difficult, but rather I am having some fun with the programming whilist it
  is challenging in certain extent. For example, it is always stressful to see a lot of bugs but it is also a
  thrilling yet rewarding experience to find the information and actually solve the problem.
