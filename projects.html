    <br>
    The entire application is split into two major areas:
    <ul>
      <li>Text files which represents the content</li>
      <li> JavaScript files which parse and generate the htmls to serve the visitors</li>
    </ul>
    The application have underdone two times of refactors:
    <ul>
      <li> A change to the script to build all the html files to deploy to static site hosting provider, <a
          href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a></li>
      <li> A complete separation of the data layor and view layer by making use of the MVC framework such as Vue.</li>
    </ul>
    The application is current hosted at <a href="https://junichi2000.jp.eu.org" target="_blank">here</a> (Japanese).
